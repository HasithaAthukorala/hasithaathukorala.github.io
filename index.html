                        <li>Designed and implemented a self-recovering system to facilitate the migration of live,
                            deployed applications (approximately 10,000 applications), conducting in-depth failure
                            analysis to ensure seamless transition and minimal disruption.</li>
                        <li>Led a team of 3-4 developers in the design and implementation of core microservices for the

                            architecture, improving modularity and ease of maintenance.</li>
                        <li>Introduced a framework for contract testing and a Docker image for running tests against
                            live endpoints, preventing about 10% of bugs going to production.</li>

                        <li>This is a bit complex and a big project. We have implemented our major back-end services
                            with Golang. We have separate UIs for model training and document scoring.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is one service which talks to the Argo server through the Argo Golang client. That
                            service is responsible for executing, managing and reporting Argo workflows and their
                            statuses. There is another service which talks to a Kafka broker and deploying pipelines
                            (Helm charts) through Helm Golang client. One of the other services is responsible for
                            communicating with the Kubernetes API server to manage deployments and services. I have
                            designed and implemented features in all of these services.
                        </li>
                        <li>When I was joining there, there was a major performance bottleneck in the backend due to a
                            proxy service we used. That service was stateful, persisting data in its memory, so that
                            service was not scalable. We solved that using a Kafka broker to handle the states, making
                            the service stateless to scale that up. This increased the performance to its maximum. We
                            benchmarked the progress by ‘seconds per page’ (this is a document processing product). This
                            improved document processing time by 100% (when processing 1000 documents parallely)
                        </li>
                        <li>I developed features covering all of the micro services deployed, including the front-end
                            written with React, AI library written with Python and also the back-end services written in
                            Golang
                        </li>
                        <li>I have closely worked with Argo workflows. We are using the Argo Golang client to
                            communicate with the Argo server. Once, I had to implement another side car to be attached
                            to the workflows to eliminate a bug in Argo workflows. This was a bug in Argo workflows when
                            that is being used with LinkerD service mesh -

                        </li>
                        <li>I worked closely with the customers we have for this product. They have an ongoing live
                            environment. They come sometimes with feature requests and sometimes with bugs. So I had to
                            gather their requirements, conduct in-depth analysis, and present comprehensive proposals to
                            our team for addressing customer needs effectively.

                        features I designed
                    </li>
                    <li>I owned, designed and implemented some of the major services of the product.
                        <br>Rudder - back-end service to interact with the Kubernetes API server to manage all the
                        deployments, services, ingresses, configs, secrets, etc. done by the users/customers of the
                        product
                        <br>IDP - Identity server of Choreo, We deployed WSO2 Identity server along with some custom
                        extensions I implemented with Java. I added the Anonymous Login implementation there and owned
                        and maintained the service
                    </li>
                    <li>I did a huge migration there in the production environment. When a user registers to the system,
                        he will be creating an organization. Under that organization, users can create projects. Before
                        the migration an organization was mapped to a namespace in Kubernetes. But, according to the
                        changes that came within the product design, we needed to map a namespace to a project. There
                        were around 10,000 deployments in our live production environment. During the migration I had to
                        create new namespaces and migrate all the config maps, secrets, deployments, services, ingresses
                        and etc. to the new project-based namespace from the organization-based namespace. I implemented
                        a new service to do that asynchronously through the Golang Kubernetes client. I did an in depth
                        failure analysis to identify all the possible failure points. Using those failure points, I
                        defined a set of states where the application falls within the migration. I had fallback plans
                        to execute when an application has fallen into an error state. Ultimately, I could migrate
                        around 10,000 deployments successfully.

                        applications on Kubernetes along with the Cell architecture
                    </li>
                    <li>I contributed to this project while doing an internship at WSO2
                    </li>
                    <li>We had implemented some custom resource definitions to introduce a new kind to Kubernetes - Cell
                    </li>
                    <li>I mainly worked in the Cellery Observability area. We used Isitio as the service mesh along with
                        the product. Istio will be automatically installed to the cluster along with the product
                        installation. We had our own user interface like grafana to let the users see the Cells in the
                        cluster. We fetched telemetry data from Istio and fed them to a stream processor called Siddhi
                        to process and store data to be used by the user interface. I implemented a custom adaptor for
                        Istio to fetch and transfer data to Siddhi. Then I implemented a service as an agent to fetch
                        data from Istio and then feed them to the data processing service (Siddhi) after doing some
                        modifications like attaching metadata to the dataset. Then I implemented a custom post processor
                        on top of Siddhi to process telemetry data. I had to do a deduplication process to filter out
                        duplicate traces. At that time, when a request is sent to service B from service A, through the
                        Istio adapter we received both of the tracing data from service A and service B, which caused us
                        to see them as two separate requests. Hence I added a deduplication post processor to Siddhi to
                        merge them into one and treat that as one request.

                    <li>Contract tests runner - When using a lot of microservices, sometimes, the front-end won’t know some small improvements of the back-end endpoints. Hence, the front-end gives a contract to the back-end more like an OpenAPI specification. This runner checks the validity of the given contract upon a new release of the back-end services and recognizes the places where the contract is broken by the back-end endpoint.
